# 🚀 GitHub Actions Examples

### Practical examples of CI/CD processes using GitHub Actions and Docker.

Each directory within this repository contains **an independent example of a particular GitHub Actions feature use case** - from building simple applications to complex development processes including tests, publishing and deployment.

Some module workflows are designed to create and/or push Docker images containing sample projects to DockerHub. Each of them **can be found under a different image tag** corresponding to the module name. 

See [all tags on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mwas0122/github-actions-examples/tags).

## 📦 Repository structure
📁 <a href=".github/workflows/">.github/workflows/</a> -> configurs workflows for every module \
📁 <a href="00-playground/">00-playground</a> -> tests basic functionalities \
📁 <a href="01-docker-build-and-push/">01-docker-build-and-push</a> -> 
builds, tests and publishes a Docker image \
📁 <a href="02-multi-job-artifacts/">02-multi-job-artifacts</a> -> shares Java application and Docker image (artifacts) between worflow jobs \
📁 <a href="03-deploy-via-ssh/">03-deploy-via-ssh</a> -> builds a Docker image and deploys it on a remote server via SSH
